# Define the services (containers) your app needs
services:
  # We'll call our PHP/Apache service 'web'
  web:
    # Tell Docker Compose to build an image from the
    # Dockerfile in the current directory ('.')
    build: .
    # Map port 8080 on your local machine to port 80
    # inside the container (where Apache is running)
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    # Mount the current directory into the container
    # This is great for development. If you change
    # index.php, the change will appear in the
    # container without rebuilding.
    volumes:
      - ./index.php:/var/www/html/index.php
